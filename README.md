## Examination of OU4

*If you present your solution before Deadline 1, you can stop reading now.*

If you do not get time to present your implementation before Deadline 1, you
**must** upload a zip file containing your solution to labres before the deadline.
When you do get time to present your implementation, you will present using the
files uploaded to labres. If you want to present a newer version of your implementation
you may do so, but the presentation will count as your second attempt.
